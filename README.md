# BopBot

A Twitch bot that will take song requests and automatically add them to a Spotify playlist if provided with a set number of bits, subs, or tip value.

**Note:**
* The bot needs to be modded to reply in chat.
* The bot needs another bot to signal when there are subs, bits, or tips. Streamlabs can be used.
