- improve regexp
- get approval for streamlabs API access
- more testing
- write README
- GUI front end? Doesn't seem necessary
- need a better way to determine who is giving gift subs,
  bits, and tipping and what tiers and how much. probably
  a way to do this with pytwitchAPI. However, can't ignore
  tips and those are done through streamlabs. Still would
  need to parse the streamlabs message response anyway for
  that
